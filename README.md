#Title: Images-Phase-Magnitude-Mixer

## About:
 #### Team No.21
     We are class of 2024 Systems and Biomedical Engineering, at Cairo university.

## Introduction 
Every signal's two fundamental components are phase and magnitude. Images are one of these signals. In this project, we'll combine two images with various combinations of phase and magnitude. To demonstrate that phase has the most details of the image and is more significant than magnitude, the basic concept is to combine the phase of one image with the magnitude of another image and vice versa.
if we mix two images and get the phase component of the first one and the magnitude component of the second one. the result image is close to the first image.

## Features:
* Mix 2 images' phases and magnitudes.
* select the phase/magnitude part you want from the image.
* you can apply high pass filter to the image's phase/magnitude.

## Tools:
* HTML.
* CSS.
* Python.
* Java Script.
